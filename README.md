# MIC-Fall19-RNN-Workshop
Contains a colab notebook for the Recurrent Neural Network workshop, and the corresponding solutions for the workshop. 

I worked on this workshop with Raj Movva and Jason Zhao, reusing some of the content from the spring 2019 RNN workshop.

Below is a link to the google slides presentation made to teach the content for the colab notebook. The structure of our
workshop is typicall to spend the first half of our time teaching the theory and a little bit of the math behind the 
deep learning topic for that day, then to spend the rest of the time learning by training your own network in the example 
problem that we provide through the colab notebook. For most of the other workshops I worked as a TA, helping people with the 
code for the colab notebook, which uses PyTorch
